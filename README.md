# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales SQL Analysis** project! This project dives deep into a pizza store's order history to uncover actionable insights and visualize sales patterns using **structured SQL queries**. Whether you're interested in learning how to analyze data using SQL or exploring business insights in the food sector, this project is a great example.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze four datasets containing pizza orders, details, types, and pricing. We use SQL to answer a range of business questions—from basic sales totals to advanced revenue breakdowns.

---

## 📅 Dataset Description
The analysis is based on four CSV files:

| File Name         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `orders.csv`      | Order IDs with date and time of order |
| `order_details.csv` | Item-level order data including pizza type and quantity |
| `pizzas.csv`      | Maps pizza types to sizes and prices |
| `pizza_types.csv` | Pizza names, categories, and ingredients |
